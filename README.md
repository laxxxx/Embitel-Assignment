# User Filter App

## Objective

1. **Create a simple application that:**
   - Reads data from a JSON file or REST API  
     - REST API URL: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`  
   - Displays the data in a structured list  
   - Includes a dropdown field that filters/shows data based on the selected dropdown value  
     - The **City** in the **Address** object should be displayed in the dropdown  
     - When a city is selected, only users from that city appear in the list  
   - Follows **MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel)** architecture  

## Expectations

1. **Use of MVVM / architecture with clear separation of concerns**  
2. **Clean, maintainable, and testable code**  
3. **Proper handling of REST API or local JSON data**  
4. **UI should reflect changes based on dropdown selection dynamically**  
5. **Appropriate use of any frameworks, libraries, or patterns you are comfortable with**  
   - e.g., Combine, Alamofire, etc.  
6. **Proper documentation and comments where necessary**
