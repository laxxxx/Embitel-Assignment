Objective:
Create a simple application  that:
Reads data from a JSON file or REST API. ( REST API URL: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users )
Displays the data in a structured list.
Includes a dropdown field that filters/shows data based on the selected dropdown value. The City in the Adress object should be displayed in the Drop Down. Based on the city the user information should be displayed using the Structured List.
Follows MVVM (Model-View-View Model)  architecture.
Expectations:
Use of MVVM / architecture with clear separation of concerns.
Clean, maintainable, and testable code.
Proper handling of REST API or local JSON data.
UI should reflect changes based on dropdown selection dynamically.
Appropriate use of any frameworks, libraries, or patterns you are comfortable with (e.g., Combine, Alamofire, etc.).
Proper documentation and comments where necessary.
